#### Intro
I am a Software Engineer who not only wants to produce the best code possible, but is also very interested in studying the cultural practices & mindsets that enable high-performing product teams to consistently deliver state of the art software. On a day to day basis I work as a Developer on a SaaS product at a small company and after-hours I closely follow the world of Agile, DevOps and Test Automation to better understand how we can out-perform the competition and beat them to the market. 
<br><br>

#### Currently
I am working at [APLYiD](https://www.aplyid.com/) on their SaaS product which revolutionises client onboarding in the era of Know Your Customer, Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism.

#### Some history

My first computer was an old Dell tower from my father’s work which ran Windows 2000 and had almost no RAM by today’s standards. Like all children, I wanted to play computer games but could never get them to install & run properly on this machine. It took me years to understand that this business machine was not equipped with a dedicated graphics card and the early 2000s integrated graphics chips were 
… not up to the task! As a result, I mostly got over the idea of gaming and grew up without much of it in my life. 
<br><br>

The lack of games did not get in the way of my fascination with this computer, however. I have fond memories of the paper-clip bot in Microsoft Office and some less fond memories of the horrific personal websites and videos I made using Windows Movie Maker, Microsoft Front-page and Adobe Dreamweaver. You won’t find those published here, of course; the internet has enough poor websites that I don’t feel the need to contribute any more. 
<br><br>

In high-school we had to take foreign language classes and I found that I really enjoyed German (couldn’t say the same about French class, unfortunately). I kept this up right through school and went on a school exchange to Hamburg. Later on my efforts were rewarded and I was given the opportunity to represent NZ in the German Language Olympiad in Frankfurt, a fantastic experience where I made friends with other German-learners from all over the world (who have been great hosts as I visit them on my travels!). 
<br><br>

Throughout high-school I kept myself busy developing websites for a few local businesses (a small local museum and a curtain shop, from memory). You can imagine my relief years later when I checked to make sure these websites had been replaced (by actual web developers), never to be seen again! My first foray into web applications occurred when I built a time-sheeting application for a family member using my new PHP skills which I learned at school. The only good thing about the application was that it was relatively secure; there were no plain text passwords anywhere and I had counter-measures in place for SQL-injection attacks. But needless to say, it wasn’t bug-free and on one occasion some people were paid incorrectly! That was my brutal introduction to the idea of software testing. And for the record, I haven’t touched PHP since….. 
<br><br>

Following school I shifted down to Wellington to pursue Software Engineering at Vic with a side of German (where I had spare time). I certainly wasn’t the perfect student and particularly near the start of my degree struggled a bit, getting to the point of failing an important mandatory course at the end of my first year. Faced with the prospect of waiting an entire year to repeat that course, I had to reevaluate whether this was the right path for me. Failing that course helped to clarify my vision and motivation. I decided I was up for the challenge and might as well go hard or go home (literally). The rest of my studies were not easy and countless late nights were had, but they were very rewarding and worthwhile and I never looked back.
